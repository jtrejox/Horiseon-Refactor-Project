# Horiseon-Refactor-Project

* In addition to improving accesibility the code will be optimized for search engines and for conciseness

## User story

  Users with disabilities often have a difficult time accesing poorly designed websites that are geared towards the non-diabled, because traditional web layouts don't lend themselves to ease of navigation using the tools that allow disabled people to navigate the internet.

  As a developer it is my goal to improve the design of this site to better cater to the disabled comunity and mitigate the roadblocks created by bad web design and, hopefully, mitigate the limitations created by this so that, one day, disabled users will have acces to the berth of information that the world wide web provides.

## Usage
I have implemented only slight cosmetic changes to the original site, however, the functionality for keyboard navigation and navigation using visual prompts has been improved greatly. Here are some examples of the changes.

<br>
<br>

![NavBar Image](../Horiseon-Refactor-Project/images/Navbar.jpg)
* **The nav bar list items are now highligted when they are selected through TAB as well as when they are hovered over by a mouse to improve visibility and to improve navigation.**

<br>
<br>

![Content Image](../Horiseon-Refactor-Project/images/Content.jpg)

* **The content elements are also now higligted to allow phisicaly disabled users to know where their screen reeders are focused on, I also added tabindex attributes to allow users to backtab from any content item to the main nav bar for ease of navigation**

* **The fonts sizes where also increased across the board for ease of reading to accommodate both sighted users and visualy limited users**
